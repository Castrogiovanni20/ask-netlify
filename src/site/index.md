title: Ask questions about Netlify
---


## What to ask?

- How to use a specific Netlify feature?
- How does something work behind the scenes?
- What tips are there for getting the best results on the JAMstack?

Whatever you ask, we'll do our best to answer. Even if we have to get help from somebody wiser than ourselves!

## How to ask?

We'll gather questions as issues in a [github repository](https://github.com/netlify/ask-netlify/issues). That way you can see other questions and add you support for those questions getting answered.

Why not take a look at [the questions](https://github.com/netlify/ask-netlify/issues) which have already been asked, and [open an issue](https://github.com/netlify/ask-netlify/issues/new) if you'd like to ask a question of your own.

The answers will come in a future video, or perhaps you'll help us decide on a useful tutorial or blog post.
