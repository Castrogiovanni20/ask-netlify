## The pilot

We don't even know what to call this thing. Perhaps you can help us name it? In the meantime, Phil and Gerald talk about various Netlify things and try to answer [a bunch of your questions](https://github.com/netlify/ask-netlify/milestone/1?closed=1).

Want more answers? [Just ask](https://github.com/netlify/ask-netlify/issues/new).
